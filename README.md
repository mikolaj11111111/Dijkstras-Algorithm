# Dijkstra's Algorithm - Shortest Path

## Description
Finds shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features
- Single-source shortest path
- Priority-based vertex selection
- Distance relaxation technique
- Path reconstruction capability

## Usage
Reads graph from "data.txt" and computes shortest distances from vertex 1 to all other vertices.
